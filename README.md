# API BDTOPOv3 

With this, you can build your own local IGN TOPO Database.
The API provides also a viewer to explore it. 

This api is eligible to a merge with [`parcellaire express`](https://github.com/esgn/api-parcellaire-express) to build only one product, probably in the future. 

> Inspired from [PARCELLAIRE EXPRESS](https://github.com/esgn/api-parcellaire-express)

## Dev mode
